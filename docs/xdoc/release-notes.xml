<h1>The WSO2 API Manager 1.9.0 Released!</h1>

<p>
    The WSO2 API Manager team is pleased to announce the release of version 1.9.0 of
    the Open Source API Manager.
</p>

<p>
    WSO2 API Manager is a platform for creating, managing, consuming and monitoring
    APIs. It employs proven SOA best practices to solve a wide range of API
    management challenges such as API provisioning, API governance, API security
    and API monitoring. It combines some of the most powerful and mature components
    of the WSO2's state-of-the-art Carbon platform to deliver a smooth and end-to-end
    API management experience while catering to both API publisher and API consumer
    requirements.
</p>

<p>
    WSO2 API Manager is comprised of several modules.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>API Provider:</b> Define new APIs and manage them</li>
    <li><b>API Store:</b> Browse published APIs and subscribe to them</li>
    <li><b>API Gateway:</b> The underlying API runtime based on WSO2 ESB</li>
    <li><b>API Key Manager:</b> Performs Key Generation and Key Validation functionalities</li>
</ul>

<p>
    WSO2 API Manager is developed on top of the revolutionary
    <a href="http://wso2.org/projects/carbon">WSO2 Carbon platform</a>
    (Middleware a' la carte),
    an OSGi based framework that provides seamless modularity to your SOA via
    componentization. This release also contains many new features and a range of
    optional components (add-ons) that can be installed to customize the behavior
    of the API Manager. Further, any existing features of the product which are not
    required in your environment can be easily removed using the underlying
    provisioning framework of Carbon. In brief, WSO2 API Manager can be fully
    customized and tailored to meet your exact API management needs.
